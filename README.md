# CarGr_datascraping
A Python code that uses the BeautifulSoup package to collect used car ads and goes on to do some crunching...

Market research can be a bit of a pain. Too much data in front of you, not very easy to make sense of it. 
Recently I started doing some market research on cars. I hope I land that job so I can soon afford one...
Anyways, I can't bear with pages that display around 20-ish results, then click on 'Next Page', and 'Next Page' and so on.
I thought I'd try web scraping.
Also, why not draw some analytics while I'm at it. I can maybe get some insights on what prices to expect and have a basis to compare.

This code comprises two modules. 
The first one scrapes the car data from the webpage and arranges them into a pandas-friendly form.
The second one attempts a linear correlation between several variables.
